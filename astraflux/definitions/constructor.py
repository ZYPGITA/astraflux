    Abstract base class for constructing service instances (RPC servers).

    This class extends Constructor to provide additional functionality
    specific to services, which typically handle remote procedure calls,
    API requests, and external communications. Services are long-running
    components that expose functionality to other parts of the system or
    external clients.

    ServiceConstructor serves as a factory and configuration template
    for creating service instances. The __call__() method enables the

    queues, and perform computational work. Workers are designed to handle
    processing tasks asynchronously and efficiently.

    WorkerConstructor serves as a factory and configuration template for
    creating worker instances. The __call__() method enables the class to
    be used as a callable factory, and the run() method defines the
    core processing logic that workers must implement.
